This is a practice project in my Internship in Trunk Studio.
We use Python and Selenium to scrape the webpage content in ticket booking system which called KKTIX, and use Python code to complete the automatic booking procedure in KKTIX system.

**USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK AND OPEN `scraipes.ipynb` TO RUN!**
